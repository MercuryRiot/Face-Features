# Face-Features

[MercuryRiot/Face-Features](https://github.com/MercuryRiot/Face-Features) is a Python-based project focused on facial feature detection and analysis. This repository provides tools and scripts for extracting, analyzing, and working with facial features using computer vision and machine learning technologies.

## Features

- **Facial Feature Detection**: Accurately detect key facial landmarks (eyes, nose, mouth, etc.) in images.
- **Image Processing**: Utilities for loading, preprocessing, and visualizing face images.
- **Python Ecosystem**: Built entirely in Python for flexibility and ease of use.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Main programming language.
- **Computer Vision Libraries**: Likely uses OpenCV, dlib, or similar for image and facial landmark processing.
- **Machine Learning**: May include classical or deep learning models for feature extraction or recognition.
- **NumPy & Pillow**: For image and array manipulation.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Ideal for experimentation and visualization (if included).

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MercuryRiot/Face-Features.git
   cd Face-Features
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**  
   Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Typical dependencies may include:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python dlib numpy pillow
   ```

3. **Usage:**  
   - Run Python scripts to process images and extract facial features.
   - Inspect documentation and comments in the scripts for specific usage details.
