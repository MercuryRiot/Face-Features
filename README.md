This Python project implements a real-time face and eye detector. It utilizes OpenCV for computer vision tasks, including face and eye detection using pre-trained Haar Cascade classifiers. The project features a user-friendly GUI built with Tkinter, allowing users to either upload an image or use their webcam as input. The detected faces and eyes are visualized with bounding boxes on the displayed image or video stream.
